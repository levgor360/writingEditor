  ### Starting from an axiom

  In our quest to understand life, our first step must start with an axiom. Every field of study needs such a starting point - a claim which, although indefensible, is a conjecture safe enough to begin the journey. Geometry launches from axioms such as that a line is the shortest distance between two points. Algebra rests on claims like the transitive property of equality - that if two values are equal to a third value, then they must also be equal to each other. Logic begins with the law of non-contraditiction - for example, that it can't be that something exists and does not exist at the same time. These statements are so self-evident that we cannot find claims even more obvious in which to ground them. Once established, they serve as keystones which uphold more complex ideas, each holding on to the last and paving the path to discovering something new entirely.

  Our voyage into biological philosophy and bioethics is no exception. We need an ethical precept on which the bridge into the unknown can stand. Let us start with this: that living beings are inherently valuable and good. The claim is hard to argue against. Anyone challenging the claim is leveling criticism of a fellowship to which they are a member. Without living beings there would be no valuation to speak of, and no ethics.

  Our axiom is essential as much as it is self-evident. It offers our first foothold in our climb towards a knowledge framework which will encapsulate ideology. From this starting point, we can begin to deduce what promotes life and is inherently good, what hinders its growth and is inherently bad, and how ideology looks when painted in these colors.

  The axiom presents us with some challenges, however. Holding a claim as self-evident does not automatically render it transparent. By stating that a line is the shortest distance between two points, geometry does not automatically define what a point is - something infinitely small yet existing, which seemingly contradicts an axiom of logic. Likewise, our ethical axiom doesn't extend any insight into what life is. How are we to define life? What is it that we are committing to cherish and protect? Many a great thinker have devoted tomes to arrive at any sensible definition of life. To make our path a little shorter, we will start from an inverse question: what is not life?

  Against life's vibrancy, the backdrop with which it contasts is the material world - an unmotivated, indifferent and chaotic medium. Life persists in a state of constant activity. It is oriented towards growth, complexity and self-propagation. The rest of the universe marches to a different beat: towards stasis, discontinuity and a bleak, cold final state.

  This distinction, seemingly obvious at first, proves difficult to pin down once we begin to grasp for concerete differentiators. The dynamics of both living and lifeless activity come in such rich variety that any single feature we elect to distinguish the two is bound to stumble on oddities where the line gets blurry. If we claim that only the living eat and breathe, we discover that fires likewise enjoy a diet of fuel and oxygen. If we say that only the living grow, we find that crystals also grow. The most robust defintion identifies life by its exceptional level of complexity, but even this proves problematic. The simplest bacteria can look like little more than clockwork. Meanwhile, inorganic entities like hurricanes, stars and black holes sustain such a a mind-boggling degree of complexity and perseverance that we reflexively antropomorphize them with qualities like deliberation and personality.

  ### Life is order

  Both physicists and biologists recognize living beings for their statistically aberrant level of order. Astounding is not only the intricacy of their design but also its perseverance. We exist as a result of many moving parts faithfully executing the same operations with a preternatural degree of fidelity. This consistent complexity sets life apart from the rest of the material world.

  The problem of using order as Geiger counter for identifying life is that order is not something we can stretch down a ruler or put on a scale. In many ways, order is a matter of personal insight and perpsective. A tapestry may seem disorderly at the level of individual strands until one steps back and appreciates the larger painting. People have studied math for thousands of years, yet before the 18th century they were certain that the appearance of prime numbers in a number line was utterly random. Then Riemann came along and now we know that their distribution is in fact patterned. If our ability to recognize patterns matures over time, how can we develop a reliable criterion to distinguish order right here and now?

  The journey of science towards putting numbers to the orderly design began with the discovery of Ludwig Boltzmann, when, in 1875, he devised a mathematical method for quantifying the level of order in a particular arrangement. Before he offered this method, appreciation of life's order was left to opinion, breeding much confusion and fruitless arguments. Once he established this foothold, biology was able to objectively differentiate the subjects of their study from the products of natural forces and machines.

  Boltzmann came upon his discovery by imagining the simplest possible model to depict the behavior of physical particles — a rudimentary microverse later dubbed Boltzmann's box. Instead of considering all the fancies of the molecular world, he collapsed the world of particles into identical, round billiard balls rolling around inside a box. He abstracted away all complex forces involved, focusing on simple mechanics of rolling and bouncing that we would see on the billiard table. By doing so, he was able to illustrate a fundamental tendency to which all particles would be subjected, irrespective of any additional complexities we might subsequently append to them.

  Lets start with eight identical particles inside a box, numbered one through eight for the sake of keeping track of their arrangement. We can introduce order to this box by drawing a dividing line down the middle and setting all the particles to one side of the divider. There's a clear pattern to this arrangement — all balls on one side and none on the other — but how do we measure this orderliness?

  Boltzmann put a number to the obvious consistency we see by asking the following question: taking one ball at a time, how many different ways are there to assign them to either left or right of the divide and arrive at this exact arrangement? In other words, if we pick up each particle one-by-one, how many different options will we have to place the particle either to the left or right of the divider and achieve the pattern where all balls are, say, on the left? The answer is self-evident: we must choose left eight times in a row to arrive at an arrangement where they are all on the left.

  So far everything is painfully obvious. Boltzmann's insight was to see what happens to our number of possible arrangement options once we start violating the predefined order. He realized that the very lack of options in sorting an orderly arrangement can be used as a numerical definition of order.

  We can get a feel for this strict necessity order demands by upsetting the order ever so slightly. Let's allow for one outlier, which we will situation to the right of the divide, away from everyone else. How many ways are there to allocate the particles now? Well, we can take particle 1 and place it on the right and all else on the left, or make ball number two the exception, or 3, and so on. The number of options ballooned form one to eight. Eight particles, eight options.

  Boltzamm termed these different patterning options as "complexions". By counting the amount of complexions available for a particular configuration, Boltzamm was able to put a number to orderliness. The more we disturb a perfect arrangement, the more complexions we have available. With two particles on the offending side, the number of complexions jumps to 28. When there is no pattern at all, when the balls are equally distributed to either side of the divide, our number of complexions for eight particles peaks at 70.

  Boltzmann's method isn't limited to ordering items to either side of a line. The logic can be applied with equal merit to any other order we may choose as a standard. It can measure how intermixed red particles are among blue ones, or how well a library organized its book by genre. Every set of items can assume a diverse array of arrangements, or macrostates, as Boltzmann called them. And every macrostate has a calculable set of complexions, or microstates, to reproduce it. Across all cases - the fewer complexions available, the higher the order.

  What insight does this shed on the living? Capable now to objecively distinghuish order, we see that the particles that make up a living being are constrained to an exceedingly narrow range of possible arrangements. This consistency is imperative to sustain the complex patterns and processes we recognize as life. In contrast, a rock can have its contituent atoms arranged in all kinds of ways and in all these variants still remain rock. Non-living objects don't lose any feature, characteristic or functionality when you rearrange their composite elements. Life permits no such flexibility - the slightest deviation from a highly specific ordering of components spells death upon the organism, forever robbing it of an essential quality which made it what it was.

  ### Death

  By now we have identified three very different facets of the same phenomenon - the uptick of complexions in the arrangement of particles, the loss of order and the drop of temperature. Rudolf Clausius, Boltzmann's predecessor, gave this singular phenomenon with many faces a name - entropy. Although he didn't yet understand all the implications of this universal tendency, he recognized the unfavorable consequence it holds for us. Entropy is a loss of opportunity to direct energy to do our bidding. Living beings residing at a scale multiple magnitudes larger than individual particles. What appears in the microverse as a triumph of diversity, to us on the macroscale manifests as a loss of opportunity. Entropy robs us of the concentrated thermal energy needed to drive change and sustain order.

  The degradation process of increasing entropy culminates in a state called equilibrium. In this state, all energy reserves are wiped out. All temperatures are averaged to a uniform cool, without any pocket of heat remaining. Every transformation which could have taken place has already done so. While on the microscale particles continue to jostle about, on the observable scale everything grinds to a standstill. This entropic state cannot drive pistons or burn stars and warm planets with their rays. It cannot sustain the delicate machinery composing living beings. What remains is matter stripped of any potential for change.

  Entropy prevails at every scale you choose to appreciate it at. It prevails in every particular locale as much as it prevails for the universe as a whole. When the universe came into existence, it had a finite reservoir of transformational energy to spend - a cosmic savings account that is steadily drained with every alteration. From the titanic electric bill of a glowing galaxy to the infinitesimal expense of a self-propelling bacterium, this savings is being depleted without anything to replenish it. The story of the universe is finite. Probability itself guarantees that the end of all history will come. This end will look like a cool, dreary state in which all stars fade, and everything submerges into a still, cold, eternall darkness.

  This realization weighs on our consciousness like a heavy stone which we would like to dislodge to reclaim a sense of comfort in our surrounding. There is something hollow and soulless about the entropic disposition of all that exists. How do we reconcile our ambitions with the conclusion Boltzmann forced upon us - that reality is not only indifferent to our plight, but determinably hazardous to it? How do we come to terms with the fact that the beautiful and captivating universe which has mothered us into existence aspires to see us as a cold, motionless mass that has no hope of striving towards anything ever again?

  Each of us must find peace with this truth on our own. The only solace we have is in each other. If you find this culmination unsettling, then you are in good company. Equilibrium is a state that is at odds with the aspirations of any and every living being, from the unicellulars to the whale. Living beings dream of growth, progress, and a future where our descendants continue to flourish. The inanimate world marches towards decay, stasis and a desolate future stripped of all hope.

  In this distinction we have arrived at an answer to the question which we posed at the start of the chapter: what life is and how to differentiate it from lifeless matter. The discovery of entropy was a breakthrough not just in thermodynamics, but also in biology and ethics. Entropy is life's archnemesis - it not only disrupts the internal composition of the organism, it exhausts the very potential for energy to drive change and sustain new organisms. Against the backdrop of a peretual fall towards equilibrium, life stands out as exceptional.

  By examining the juncture where life diverges from entropy-driven matter, we have arrived at our first objective moral tenets. Our separation from the surrounding rests on two distinguishing features. The first one is order. For nearly a third of the history of the universe, life has defied statistical probabilty and resisted the randomizing forces tht govern all else. The second one is activity. Living beings are always doing something. Rather than being a static order, the order sustained by life is in a state of continuous transformation. In the face of disorder's onslaught, life must continually struggle to discover new pockets of energy reserves to repair the damage exacted by forces which want to see it still and impotent.

  If order and action are the apostles of life's magnificence, then humans have been of great service to life's grand design. Through science and technology, we have learned to impose new patterns and exploit sources of energy which nature, if left to its own devices, would never have accessed on its own. Gifted by reason, we have become architects of improbability. But there is a deep irony to this triumph. Somewhere in our tour de force we went astray. We build ever more complex systems to cater to our whims, but at some point these systems began to sow the seeds of our own demise.

  Entropy festers in human affairs, in the form of declining social cohesion, environmental degradation and a troubled mind. Like particles in Boltzmann's box, we find ourselves drifting apart, our collective commitment to progress fragmenting into divergent pursuits. This drift toward disorder is not inevitable. It is a result of the choices we made. In the negative of entropy's defining features, we are able to find some guidance to redemption. But currently our map is two-dimensional, offering only two axes on which we have difficulty to plot both our location or destination. To make this guide useful, we need to look deeper into the methods by which organisms were able to cheat entropy for so long, as well as how they have faltered in their commitment to exist before.
